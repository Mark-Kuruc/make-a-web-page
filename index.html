          A user opens a <em>browser</em> on a device and searches for a website. The <em>browser</em> should then connect to the <em>internet</em> if not already connected. The <em>internet</em> then retieves the website from a <em> server</em> using <em>HTTP</em>.

          - HTML is the building block for a webpage. It allows you to add images, text, and links to a webpage.
        </p>
        <p>
          - CSS allows the programmer to change the style of the webpage. It allows you to change the "look" of the webpage by changing the colors, fonts, and styles.
        </p>
        <p>
          - View a webpage as an organized set of blocks on a grid. Each block can have blocks within them. Blocks can consist of an image, header, menu,or other items.Each block can therefore be defined to have it's on width, font, or other assigned style class.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Scratchpad.io, CodePen.io and Sublime each have their strengths and weaknesses for text editing. We will use scratchpad for the time being and utilize CodePen to share our webpages.

        Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="topic-body"> 
      	<p>
      		Repetition is strongly discouraged for the following reasons:
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		<b>Programming Errors:</b> The more lines of code that is written, the more likely an error will be made by the programmar. Syntax errors are one of the main types of errors and this can be minimized by the use of CSS which will be discussed below.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		<b>Visual Consistency:</b> When creating a webpage, you want it to look appealing and easy to follow. To do this, CSS allows class styles to be formed for <em> boxes</em> that have the same style throughout the webpage. This allows headers, body text, titles and so forth to have a consistent look and feel.
      	</p>
      	<p>
      		<b>Webpage Bandwidth:</b> Webpage bandwidth and size depends on the number of lines of HTML code among other things such as image size. To reduce the amount of lines of code, CSS allows the programmer to write a class style and refer to that repeatedly instead of writing repetitive lines of code.
      	</p>
      </div>
      <div class="topic-title">
        The Use of CSS
      </div>
      <div class="topic-body">
      	<p>
      		CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets. It allows programmers to change the style and <em>"feel"</em> of related HTML elements. Similar HTML elements are given the same <em>"class"</em> name. Each class has it's own defined style where the programmar can select the font weight, font style, as well as other items.
